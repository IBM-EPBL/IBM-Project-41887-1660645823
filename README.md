Project Description:
  Food is essential for human life and has been the concern of many healthcare conventions. Nowadays new dietary assessment and nutrition analysis tools enable more
  opportunities to help people understand their daily eating habits, exploring nutrition patterns and maintain a healthy diet. Nutritional analysis is the process 
  of determining the nutritional content of food. It is a vital part of analytical chemistry that provides information about the chemical composition, processing, 
  quality control and contamination of food.
   The main aim of the project is to building a model which is used for classifying the fruit depends on the different characteristics like colour, shape, texture etc.
   Here the user can capture the images of different fruits and then the image will be sent the trained model. The model analyses the image and detect the nutrition
   based on the fruits like (Sugar, Fibre, Protein, Calories, etc.).


 Data Collection:
    Collect images of different food items organized into subdirectories based on their respective names as shown in the project structure.

Image Preprocessing:
    1. Import The ImageDataGenerator Library
    2. Configure ImageDataGenerator Class
    3.Apply Image DataGenerator Functionality To Trainset And Testset
    
Model Building:
   1. Importing The Model Building Libraries
   2. Initializing The Model
   3. Adding CNN Layers
   4. Adding Dense Layers
   5. Configure The Learning Process
   6. Train our Model
   7. Save our model
   8. Test our model
 
 Train the  model on IBM
   1.  Register For IBM clous
   2.  Train Model On IBM
